All 6 results come from the Zod repository, which is exactly what someone searching for 'zod schema validation' would want. The README (rank 1) explicitly discusses schema declaration and validation. The MIGRATION, CHANGELOG, and ERROR_HANDLING documents all relate to Zod's validation functionality. Even the source file (types.ts) contains schema-related code.","ranking":"The ranking is very good. The README is correctly placed at rank 1 as the primary documentation source for understanding Zod schema validation. ERROR_HANDLING at rank 4 is arguably more relevant than CHANGELOG at rank 3 for someone learning about validation (since error handling is integral to validation), but this is a minor issue. The source file at rank 6 is appropriately ranked lowest among documentation-focused results.","coverage":"Coverage is good but not exhaustive. The search found the main documentation files (README, MIGRATION, CHANGELOG, ERROR_HANDLING, CONTRIBUTING) and one source file. However, for a comprehensive search on 'zod schema validation', one might expect to see more source files showing actual validation implementations, or example files if they exist. The CONTRIBUTING.md result seems tangential - it's only relevant because it mentions documentation, not validation itself.","snippetQuality":"Snippet quality is mixed. The README snippet is excellent - it directly explains what Zod is ('schema declaration and validation library'). The ERROR_HANDLING snippet shows actual validation error output which is useful. However, the MIGRATION snippet focuses on cloning behavior rather than validation concepts. The CHANGELOG snippet shows version changes but doesn't highlight validation-specific content well. The CONTRIBUTING snippet is barely relevant. The types.ts snippet shows internal implementation details (ZodTuple, deepPartialify) which may not be the most helpful preview for understanding validation."},"suggestions":["Improve snippet extraction to prioritize sections containing the actual query terms ('schema', 'validation') rather than arbitrary document sections","Consider boosting results that contain query terms in headings or prominent positions within the document","Add semantic understanding to differentiate between primary documentation (README, guides) and secondary files (CONTRIBUTING, CHANGELOG) for documentation-intent queries","The CONTRIBUTING.md result (rank 5) adds little value for this query - consider filtering or demoting results where query term matches are incidental rather than substantive","For source code files, extract snippets that show the public API or usage examples rather than internal implementation details"],"resultAssessments":[{"rank":1,"source":"zod/README.md","relevant":true,"note":"Highly relevant - primary documentation for Zod schema validation.
